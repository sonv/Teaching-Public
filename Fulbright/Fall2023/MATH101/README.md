## Textbook(s) and References 
Textbook: How to prove it? (2nd edition) by Daniel J. Velleman

There are a few books that I highly recommend if you are motivated.
- [*Infinite Descent*](https://infinitedescent.xyz/) by Newstead. This book was written
by my pal Clive Newstead for a course similar to Math 170 (but slightly more demanding and standardized) and it was an instant hit at Carnegie Mellon University.
It is free and will be the main reference for a lot of the materials I plan to cover.
-  [*What is mathematics?*](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Elementary-Approach-Ideas-Methods/dp/0195105192) by Courant, Robbins and Stewart. This is a classic written
by two giants in modern mathematics. 
It was written to help teachers and students "look beyond mathematical formalism and manipulation and to grasp 
the real essence of mathematics."
- [*Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org). In my opinion, this is the best source 
to learn about basic concepts in general (not just mathematics) if you know what
you are looking for.


## Course description
This course, if successful, will help students explore how to read and write mathematics.
At its best, mathematics contains all of the following: creativity, beauty and, of course, precision.
A masterpiece in mathematics could be compared to a great drawing or a classic novel.
As an example, Martin Hairer's [*regularity structure*](https://www.quantamagazine.org/hearing-music-in-noise-martin-hairer-wins-the-fields-medal-20140812) is compared to *Lord of the Rings*
on Quanta Magazine.

We will start with the basic language of modern mathematics, logic and set theory.
Then, depending on the interests of students, we will talk about some (but not limited to) of the following topics: infinity, number theory, combinatorics, probability, game theory,
linear algebra, discrete and/or differential dynamical systems.
Along the way, we will find real world applications of the above subjects.


## Learning objectives
Two things:
- I hope this course will help you have fun and nerdy conversations with friends (or strangers on the bus), whether they're math people or not.
At the least, if you don't like the awkward silence, strike a conversation about $\infty$!
- I hope you will find beauty in mathematics by knowing that mathematics is all about ideas, 
not computations (although computations play a big part in the usefulness of mathematics).

## Tentative Syllabus (subject to change)

1. Warm-up (1 week): read Introduction and Notes on Pigeonhole Principle

2. Sentential Logic (2 weeks)

3. Quantificational Logic (2 weeks)

4. Proofs (2 weeks)

5. Relations (2 weeks)

6. Functions (1 week)

7. Mathematical Induction (1 week)

8. Fun topics (1 week)


## Class Policies (subject to change)
### Lectures
- If you must sleep, please don't snore. (Thanks [Gautam Iyer](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/) for this amazing policy!)
- Please be respectful to your classmates.

### Attendance
I don't take attendance. It's up to you to decide if it's worth it to go to
class.

### Quizzes
There will be quizzes every day.
There will be no make-up quizzes.
Three worst quizzes will be dropped, however.

### Homework
- Homework must be turned in **by the beginning of the class** on the due date. 
- All homework must be turned in via paper but you need to submit a scanned version to Canvas for proof of submission.
- Collaboration for homework is strongly encouraged but you **MUST** write up your own work. Word-to-word copying is plagiarism.
- Generously credit all of the people who you collaborate with at the beginning of your work.
- If you use outside sources (internet, books, friends, etc.) for a particular problem, acknowledge them at the beginning of the problem.
You will **NOT** be penalized for consulting outside sources as long as you credit them.
- **Late homework policy:** 
    - Late homework will NOT be accpeted. However, the two worst homeworks will be dropped.
- Advice:
    - Eat well and get enough sleep.
    - Start early. One problem per day is more pleasant than seven problems in one night.
    - Try to understand the materials rather than rote memorization. This will show in exams.
    - Try to write clearly and demonstrate clarity of thoughts.


### Grading (subject to change)
- Homework: 30%
- Daily quizzes: 25%
- Project: 20% 
- Final: 25%


## Time Expectations
On average, you should expect to be roughly 3 hours in class per week, which are included in a total of 10 working hours per course per week. If you are finding it difficult to complete your work in time, please come talk to me ASAP so that we can diagnose the issue and adjust accordingly. If something is not working for you, please do not hesitate to raise it in one of the feedback sessions or come see me outside of class.

## Academic Dishonesty 
As Fulbright University’s Code of Academic Integrity explains: “plagiarism occurs when a writer appropriates another's ideas, research, or writing without proper acknowledgement of the source or uses another's words without the use of quotation marks, whether intentional or not.”  All Fulbright students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the Code of Academic Integrity. In order to help students become familiar with the concepts of academic integrity, citation, and plagiarism, all students are required to complete Level 1 (November 14th 2022) and Level 2 (December 29th  2022) of the Academic Integrity Credential (available on Canvas). Academic misconduct (including plagiarism, cheating, and other violations of the Code of Academic Integrity) will be investigated according to this code and may be subject to sanctions including reduced grade, failure, academic warning, academic probation, academic suspension, or withholding of degree. If you have questions about plagiarism, you should contact your teacher or the Learning Support Team at learningsupport@fulbright.edu.vn . 
 
Learning Support 
Please remember that “Help is always available at FUV, if you just reach out!”. There are ample resources available to help you survive and thrive on your academic journey. The Fulbright Learning Support team can provide you with guidance in the following areas:  
•	Academic skills (e.g., Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking and Presentation) 
•	Study skills (e.g., Time management, Planning your Assignments, Task Management, Note-taking Skills)  
•	Research-related skills (e.g., Selecting Peer-reviewed Journals, Qualitative Coding, Planning a Research Project) 
•	Exam strategies & Test-taking skills  
•	Academic Integrity (e.g., Avoiding Plagiarism, Paraphrasing Skills, Citing and Referencing) 
•	Individual Learning Plan (i.e., Brainstorming, Planning, Prioritizing, Monitoring, Reflection on Learning) 
•	Making use of the Work-in-Progress Learning Guides for independently learning fundamental academic skills and study skills 
•	Discipline-related content (e.g., Arts, History, Vietnam Studies)  
 
Support for these areas includes Workshops, Skill Practice Sessions and Group Advising Sessions organized during the semesters, and you can also refer to the Study Skills & Academic Skills 101 canvas module. Additionally, if you would like to have one-on-one advising/ mentoring sessions to discuss your specific academic concerns (e.g., how to improve your thesis statement, how to ‘polish’ your academic writing style, identify your strengths and weaknesses in your academic reading skills), you can book an appointment with a learning support staff member or with a peer mentor via the booking link.  
 If you have further questions about learning support, please send an email to learning.support@fulbright.edu.vn
