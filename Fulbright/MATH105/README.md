This is the repository hosting some of the materials
relating to the coding part of the course Introduction to
Data Analysis, taught by SV at Fulbright University Vietnam.

---

In order to complete the coding/ data analysis section, students are encouraged
to use [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
The language that is officially discussed in this class is Python.
Some students may be more familiar with R. However, everyone is required to turn
in their work in Python.
You may, however, use R (even, alas, Excel) to check the correctness of your work.
