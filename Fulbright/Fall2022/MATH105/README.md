## Textbook(s) and References 
We will use interchangeably the following texts as main references. 
You don't have to own a copy as most concepts are available online. 
Some homework, however, will be taken from these texts. I'll make
sure you have access to the homework questions by one way or another.
- Introductory Statistics: A Problem-Solving Approach, by Stephen Kokoska.
- An introcution to Statistical Methods & Data Analysis, by Ott and Longnecker.

## Course description
How do we know which Covid-19 vaccine is better? Which combination of policies could help promoting start-up companies? These questions could be answered with the help of Data analysis. Social scientists need to process survey results. Natural scientists want to analyze experiment's outcomes. Modern statistical methods and state of the art computing software can help finding valuable information from a large and confusing data set. This course will provide students with basic statistics concepts and practical coding skill in Python. Students will be able to describe and find characteristic of the data, explore, and confirm relationship among data, and draw answer for questions from their own discipline via hand-on experience with various projects. Some main topics are data visualization, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, parametric and non-parametric hypothesis testing, ANOVA. A strong background in Mathematics or Computer Science is not required, just a desire to learn is enough.


## Learning objectives
Student will be able to
1. Understand the basic concepts and methods of Statistics.
2. Perform fundamental steps of important procedures and methods. 
3. Apply Statistics models to real world problems and construct step-by-step solutions.
4. Use Python to program algorithms and compute solutions.

## Class Policies (subject to change)
### Lectures
- If you must sleep, please don't snore. (Thanks [Gautam Iyer](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/) for this amazing policy!)
- Please be respectful to your classmates.

### Attendance
- I don't take attendance. It's up to you to decide if it's worth it to go to
class.

### Homework
- Homework must be turned in **by 23:59 p.m. ET** on the due date. 
- All homework must be scanned and submitted electronically and I DO NOT accept late homework.
- Collaboration for homework is strongly encouraged but you **MUST** write up your own work. Word-to-word copying is plagiarism.
- Generously credit all of the people who you collaborate with at the beginning of your work.
- If you use outside sources (internet, books, friends, etc.) for a particular problem, acknowledge them at the beginning of the problem.
You will **NOT** be penalized for consulting outside sources as long as you credit them.
- **Late homework policy:** 
    - Late homework will NOT be accepted. However, the three worst homeworks will be dropped.
- Advice:
    - Eat well and get enough sleep.
    - Start early. One problem per day is more pleasant than seven problems in one night.
    - Try to understand the materials rather than rote memorization. This will show in exams.
    - Try to write clearly and demonstrate clarity of thoughts.


### Grading (subject to change)
- Homework: 50%
- Midterm: 15%
- Group presentation video: 20%
- Project: 15% 

## Time Expectations
On average, you should expect to be roughly 3 hours in class per week, which are included in a total of 10 working hours per course per week. If you are finding it difficult to complete your work in time, please come talk to me ASAP so that we can diagnose the issue and adjust accordingly. If something is not working for you, please do not hesitate to raise it in one of the feedback sessions or come see me outside of class.

## Academic Dishonesty 
As Fulbright University’s Code of Academic Integrity explains: “plagiarism occurs when a writer appropriates another's ideas, research, or writing without proper acknowledgement of the source or uses another's words without the use of quotation marks, whether intentional or not.”  All Fulbright students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the Code of Academic Integrity. In order to help students become familiar with the concepts of academic integrity, citation, and plagiarism, all students are required to complete Level 1 (November 14th 2022) and Level 2 (December 29th  2022) of the Academic Integrity Credential (available on Canvas). Academic misconduct (including plagiarism, cheating, and other violations of the Code of Academic Integrity) will be investigated according to this code and may be subject to sanctions including reduced grade, failure, academic warning, academic probation, academic suspension, or withholding of degree. If you have questions about plagiarism, you should contact your teacher or the Learning Support Team at learningsupport@fulbright.edu.vn . 
 
Learning Support 
Please remember that “Help is always available at FUV, if you just reach out!”. There are ample resources available to help you survive and thrive on your academic journey. The Fulbright Learning Support team can provide you with guidance in the following areas:  
•	Academic skills (e.g., Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking and Presentation) 
•	Study skills (e.g., Time management, Planning your Assignments, Task Management, Note-taking Skills)  
•	Research-related skills (e.g., Selecting Peer-reviewed Journals, Qualitative Coding, Planning a Research Project) 
•	Exam strategies & Test-taking skills  
•	Academic Integrity (e.g., Avoiding Plagiarism, Paraphrasing Skills, Citing and Referencing) 
•	Individual Learning Plan (i.e., Brainstorming, Planning, Prioritizing, Monitoring, Reflection on Learning) 
•	Making use of the Work-in-Progress Learning Guides for independently learning fundamental academic skills and study skills 
•	Discipline-related content (e.g., Arts, History, Vietnam Studies)  
 
Support for these areas includes Workshops, Skill Practice Sessions and Group Advising Sessions organized during the semesters, and you can also refer to the Study Skills & Academic Skills 101 canvas module. Additionally, if you would like to have one-on-one advising/ mentoring sessions to discuss your specific academic concerns (e.g., how to improve your thesis statement, how to ‘polish’ your academic writing style, identify your strengths and weaknesses in your academic reading skills), you can book an appointment with a learning support staff member or with a peer mentor via the booking link.  
 If you have further questions about learning support, please send an email to learning.support@fulbright.edu.vn
