## Class Policies (subject to change)
### Lectures
- If you must sleep, please don't snore. (Thanks [Gautam Iyer](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/) for this amazing policy!)
- Please be respectful to your classmates.

### Attendance
- I don't take attendance. It's up to you to decide if it's worth it to go to
class.

### Homework
- Homework must be turned in **by 23:59 p.m. ET** on the due date. 
- All homework must be scanned and submitted electronically and I DO NOT accept late homework.
- Collaboration for homework is strongly encouraged but you **MUST** write up your own work. Word-to-word copying is plagiarism.
- Generously credit all of the people who you collaborate with at the beginning of your work.
- If you use outside sources (internet, books, friends, etc.) for a particular problem, acknowledge them at the beginning of the problem.
You will **NOT** be penalized for consulting outside sources as long as you credit them.
- **Late homework policy:** 
    - Late homework wll NOT be accpeted. However, the three worst homeworks will be dropped.
- Advice:
    - Eat well and get enough sleep.
    - Start early. One problem per day is more pleasant than seven problems in one night.
    - Try to understand the materials rather than rote memorization. This will show in exams.
    - Try to write clearly and demonstrate clarity of thoughts.


### Grading (subject to change)
- Homework: 70%
- Project: 30% 

## Wellness
-In general, take good care of your health. 
-You're a human being first, before a student.
-Your academinc performance will be affected if you are not in good health.

## Academic Integrity
-Please read the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/article/Violations-of-The-Code-of-Academic-Integrity) carefully.

-Cheating will **NOT** be tolerated and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. In the worst case, it can result in expulsion.

That said, make sure you keep the following points:
- Discussing homework is not cheating and strongly encouraged.
- You need to write up your own solutions after discussions. Word-by-word copying is cheating.
