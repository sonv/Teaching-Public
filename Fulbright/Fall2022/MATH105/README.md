## Textbook(s) and References 
We will use interchangeably the following texts as main references. 
You don't have to own a copy as most concepts are available online. 
Some homework, however, will be taken from these texts. I'll make
sure you have access to the homework questions by one way or another.
- Introductory Statistics: A Problem-Solving Approach, by Stephen Kokoska.
- An introcution to Statistical Methods & Data Analysis, by Ott and Longnecker.

## Course description
How do we know which Covid-19 vaccine is better? Which combination of policies could help promoting start-up companies? These questions could be answered with the help of Data analysis. Social scientists need to process survey results. Natural scientists want to analyze experiment's outcomes. Modern statistical methods and state of the art computing software can help finding valuable information from a large and confusing data set. This course will provide students with basic statistics concepts and practical coding skill in Python. Students will be able to describe and find characteristic of the data, explore, and confirm relationship among data, and draw answer for questions from their own discipline via hand-on experience with various projects. Some main topics are data visualization, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, parametric and non-parametric hypothesis testing, ANOVA. A strong background in Mathematics or Computer Science is not required, just a desire to learn is enough.


## Learning objectives
Student will be able to
1. Understand the basic concepts and methods of Statistics.
2. Perform fundamental steps of important procedures and methods. 
3. Apply Statistics models to real world problems and construct step-by-step solutions.
4. Use Python to program algorithms and compute solutions.

## Tentative Syllabus
1.	Descriptive statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis
    -	Random variable
    -	Bar, pie, line charts
    -	Histogram
    -	Basics of Pandas: select row, column; merge, split data frames
    -	Mean, Var, SD, median, quantile, boxplot, outlier

2.	Normal distribution
    -	Standard bell curve, z-score
    -	T-distribution
    -	Sample mean, sample SD, standard error
    -	Central Limit Theorem
    -	Confidence Interval for mean of normal
    -	Hypothesis testing, p-value
    -	Normality tests: QQ plot, Shapiro

    -	2 sample t-test: test for equality of 2 means (normal, same/not same variances)
    -	Paired t-test

3.	ANOVA
    -	One way ANOVA , F-distribution
    -	Two way ANOVA

4.	Correlation

## Class Policies (subject to change)
### Lectures
- If you must sleep, please don't snore. (Thanks [Gautam Iyer](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/) for this amazing policy!)
- Please be respectful to your classmates.

### Attendance
- I don't take attendance. It's up to you to decide if it's worth it to go to
class.

### Homework
- Homework must be turned in **by 23:59 p.m. ET** on the due date. 
- All homework must be scanned and submitted electronically and I DO NOT accept late homework.
- Collaboration for homework is strongly encouraged but you **MUST** write up your own work. Word-to-word copying is plagiarism.
- Generously credit all of the people who you collaborate with at the beginning of your work.
- If you use outside sources (internet, books, friends, etc.) for a particular problem, acknowledge them at the beginning of the problem.
You will **NOT** be penalized for consulting outside sources as long as you credit them.
- **Late homework policy:** 
    - Late homework wll NOT be accpeted. However, the three worst homeworks will be dropped.
- Advice:
    - Eat well and get enough sleep.
    - Start early. One problem per day is more pleasant than seven problems in one night.
    - Try to understand the materials rather than rote memorization. This will show in exams.
    - Try to write clearly and demonstrate clarity of thoughts.


### Grading (subject to change)
- Homework: 50%
- Group presentation video: 20%
- Project: 30% 

## Wellness
-In general, take good care of your health. 
-You're a human being first, before a student.
-Your academinc performance will be affected if you are not in good health.
- You can contact the Wellness Center via [wellness@fulbright.edu.vn](mailto:wellness@fulbright.edu.vn) or find us at the Wellness Center office on the Level 5 of our Crescent campus.


## Academic Integrity
-Please read the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/article/Violations-of-The-Code-of-Academic-Integrity) carefully.

-Cheating will **NOT** be tolerated and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. In the worst case, it can result in expulsion.

That said, make sure you keep the following points:
- Discussing homework is not cheating and strongly encouraged.
- You need to write up your own solutions after discussions. Word-by-word copying is cheating.

## Accessibility Learning Service
Fulbright University Vietnam commits to providing excellent student-centered services that supports diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility where the studentâ€™s voice and presence matters. Accessibility Learning Service provides support for students with conditions, including disability, long-term illness, mental health condition or being primary carers of individuals with a disability. ALS can meet with you to develop individualized learning plan, share your plan with your professors and provide continuing support if necessary.
